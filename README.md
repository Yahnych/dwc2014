=======

This repository contains the slides and example files for Dev Workshop Conference 2014.

After cloning this repository, `cd` to the root directory and run these these commands:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This will install the [Ga](https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga) micro game engine that some of the later examples depend on.

Next, start a webserver in the root directory. I recommend [http-server for node](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server).

You can use any text editor or IDE you're comfortable with, but [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) is particularly good for HTML5 development.
